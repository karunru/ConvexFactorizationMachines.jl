# ConvexFactorizationMachines.jl
Convex Factorization Machines (CFM) is a convex variant of the widely used FM.

ConvexFactorizationMachines.jl wraps the [pyCFM](https://github.com/myamada0321/pyCFM).

pyCFM is using Squared loss, so ConvexFactorizationMachines.jl also use squared loss.
We hope to implement logistic loss in the future.
